{/* TODO: @aman Rewrite the introduction of this page. Add box links to Create and use development builds to link to different parts of development builds journey such as creating dev build, using dev build, deep linking (not priority), etc. Check out EAS Build docs to add more info in the introduction and avoid duplication in the future. */}

{/* TODO: @aman The introduction right now is a bit too technical and contains jargon like native runtime and update. Simplify it to explain that how one benefits from creating development builds (like adding custom native code, or adding third party libraries that are not possible with Expo Go. We speak this language everywhere to explain and convince developers for example, on social media, support etc., we should speak this clear language in our docs too.) */}

Building your project with Expo allows you to make most changes in JavaScript. This helps iterate quickly and safely and allows your team to [achieve web-like iteration speeds](https://blog.expo.dev/javascript-driven-development-with-custom-runtimes-eda87d574c9d) by dividing your application into:

- **A native runtime**: A native binary that is built with Xcode or Android Studio. Expo Go is an example of a native runtime for iterating on React Native projects.
- **An update**: A bundle of your application's JavaScript code and assets (images, video, fonts, and so on). An update can be served from your local computer with Expo CLI, embedded in the binary by EAS Build, or hosted on a publicly available server.

When your project requires custom native code, a config plugin, a custom runtime version, or a reduced bundle size of the app, you can transition from using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) to develop to a development build.

## What is a development build

A **development build** of your app is a Debug build that contains the `expo-dev-client` package. As a production build is for the general public, and a preview build lets your team test your next release, a development build lets developers iterate as quickly as possible. It comes with extensible development tools to develop and test your project.

You can think of a development build as your version of the Expo Go client.

## What is an expo-dev-client

The [`expo-dev-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-dev-client) package is used to create a development build. It is a library designed to support any workflow, release process, or set of dependencies in the Expo/React Native ecosystem. Whatever your project needs, either now or in the future, you'll be able to create a development build for it and get the productivity and quality of life improvements of JavaScript-driven development.
